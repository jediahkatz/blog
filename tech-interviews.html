                            Every fall, <i>recruiting season</i> manifests as a massive source of stress for preprofessional students
                            in tech-adjacent fields. At Penn, this is most of my peers — recruiting exists in our collective 
                            consciousness as an always-hovering authoritarian parent and a scapegoat for all sorts of ills 
                            (real quote: “I can’t even think about dating until recruiting is over”).
                        </p>

                            But while interviewing is usually a source of stress for anyone, what is it that prompts some 
                            students to spend hours each day preparing, for weeks or even for months? The answer lies in 
                            the particular format of interviews for engineering positions at modern tech companies. The 
                            dreaded <i>coding interview</i> begins with the interviewer presenting the candidate with a challenging 
                            problem meant to be solved by a computer program. The rest of the interview is steered by the 
                            candidate, who must figure out on the spot how to write such a program. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            Typically, the candidate can’t come up with a full answer right away. Instead, interviewer and 
                            interviewee engage in an elaborate partner dance: the candidate chanting their thought process 
                            out loud, exploring promising ideas, and abandoning unsuccessful ones, while prodding the interviewer 
                            to offer affirmation, catch missteps, and bestow precious hints. The clock casts a long shadow — a 
                            single tough problem can take upwards of half an hour to solve, and failing to do so before the 
                            interview’s conclusion heralds a poor outlook.

                            The specifics of this type of interview, however, matter much less than the surprisingly 
                            radical philosophy that underlies it. The coding interview throws traditionally key concerns 
                            — experience, personality, breadth of knowledge — on the back burner in favor of 
                            <i>raw problem-solving prowess</i>.

                            What does this mean, exactly? Problem-solving deals with abstraction, not specifics. 
                            The company cares much less about the problem and the eventual solution than it does about 
                            the steps taken to get there. In a document released to interview candidates, Google warns:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            Our engineers are evaluating not only your technical abilities but also how you approach 
                            problems and how you try to solve them. … We want to understand how you think.
                        </blockquote>

                            lmplicit in this focus on problem-solving is an ideology that many students and professionals 
                            in tech have internalized without realizing, and one that is worth examining closely. Essentially, 
                            the claim is that experience does not really matter in the long term, only reasoning ability. The 
                            underlying logic says that a sufficiently intelligent and rational thinker doesn’t need preexisting 
                            knowledge, because anything they need to know can be “learned on the fly.” 
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            Before unpacking this, let’s look at a bit of history. The philosophy of the modern coding 
                            interview was inherited from another type of interview: the <i>case interview</i>, which was 
                            created by the management consulting industry and is still the primary format for consulting 
                            interviews. The case interview is very similar to the coding interview, but instead of a 
                            computational problem for the interviewee to solve, there is a business scenario. It’s hard 
                            to find information about the origins of the case interview, but as far as I can tell, the 
                            oldest case competition (ICBC) was first held in 1978, and the first book about the case 
                            interview (the Wharton MBA Case Interview Study Guide) was published in 1997. So it seems 
                            to have been developed over the latter half of the 20th century. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            This link reveals that the ideology of the coding interview is closely linked to the ideology 
                            of management consulting. It makes perfect sense from this point of view — consultants typically 
                            have little knowledge in advance about their specific client companies, but they try to apply 
                            abstract knowledge about the industry or even just business in general. The tech industry has 
                            embraced this way of thinking with gusto — not just internally in its hiring practices (hire 
                            smart people and spend months onboarding them), but also externally in the way that new ventures 
                            and products are conceived. There’s a whole crop of companies, from Airbnb to Redfin to Flexport, 
                            that seek to “disrupt” existing industries, utilizing lots of technology but relatively little 
                            industry experience.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            The ideology of techno-optimists and management consultants is, on its face, radically meritocratic. 
                            The notion that we should not glorify experience — that no field is immune to criticism and disruption
                             — destabilizes traditional forces of hierarchy and perhaps even disrupts the institutionalization of 
                             bad practice and narrow perspective that is all too common in the corporate world.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            But this ideology is also arrogant. Assuming that members of the professional intelligentsia can find 
                            their way in any scenario is a narrow perspective of its own and trivializes forms of intelligence that 
                            don’t translate well to the whiteboard. And although the tech world likes to think of itself as the 
                            largest meritocracy in the world, this myth has been 
                            <a href="https://istechameritocracy.com/">repeatedly debunked</a>. But the myth itself is harmful, 
                            because it legitimizes incorrect decisions and can be wielded with blunt force against valid criticism.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            Ultimately, I have faith in the many tech workers who are aware of these issues and recognize that not 
                            every problem can be reasoned out from first principles. But when an interview purports to evaluate 
                            “how you think,” it’s always worth asking what the “right” way to think really is.
