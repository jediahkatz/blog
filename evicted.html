                            After much slow progress, I recently finished <i>Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City</i>, 
                            sociologist Matthew Desmond’s 2016 book detailing how America’s private rental market has failed 
                            for too many of its poorest citizens. Although I consider myself primarily a novel reader — with 
                            the exception of my voracious consumption of news and <i>The Atlantic</i> in particular — I’ve attempted
                            to break out of my comfort zone over the past year with a few nonfiction books.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            Part exposé and part ethnography, <i>Evicted</i> follows eight poverty-stricken families in Milwaukee during
                            the Great Recession as they fall behind on rent, attend (and skip) eviction court, and place countless
                            phone calls to landlords in search of a new home, however temporary. Although the book is occasionally
                            difficult to follow due to the sheer number of characters, whose interwoven stories sporadically intersect
                            like threads in a fraying tapestry, it does a great job of painting a vivid scene to present the reader with
                            the harsh realities of tenancy and the subtle social, economic, and legal forces that uphold them.

                            Desmond’s message is difficult to brush aside, thanks not only to his painstakingly detailed reporting but
                            also to his circumspect presentation, entirely in the third person. Desmond works hard to extricate his own voice
                            from the narrative, recording the actions, thoughts, and feelings of tenants and landlords alike while declining
                            opportunities to pass judgment or editorialize beyond offering the occasional statistic. It all amounts to a book that,
                            instead of simply laying out a case and arguing it, submerges the reader in the world of urban rentals until the flaws
                            inherent in that system begin bubbling up her nose.
                        </p>

                            So without further ado, here are my own personal key takeaways. All statistics and laws I mention are from the book,
                            and likely were gathered in Milwaukee, which was chosen to most resemble the typical American city.
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                            Housing is fundamental to physical health, mental health, and self-actualization.
                        </h4>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            We use our homes to eat, work, destress, sleep, dream, and socialize. You can likely think of many conscious and
                            subconscious rituals that you perform in your own home, all of which collectively create a feeling of psychological security.
                            Eviction, then, is a traumatic event that can significantly affect the trajectory of a tenant’s life. Even after adjusting for
                            economic factors, evicted tenants are more likely to lose their jobs, more likely to be depressed in the future, and more
                            likely to experience long-term housing issues.
                        </p>
                        <h4>The rental market conflates poverty and criminality, forming a vicious cycle.</h4>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            When screening prospective tenants, landlords typically look at eviction records and
                            criminal records, which are helpfully published by courts. Renters who are screened out of most
                            properties flock to landlords with more lenient policies, and as a result impoverished tenants
                            and criminals alike end up roosting on the same block or in the same complex.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            This reverses a typical narrative of how so-called bad neighborhoods form: poverty causes desperation
                            causes crime. While there is truth to that, <i>Evicted</i> suggests that poor, high-crime areas are not that
                            way because the poor have all turned to crime, but rather because the poor are not allowed to exist anywhere else.
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                            The rental market discriminates against children, which disproportionally harms women, especially black single mothers.
                        </h4>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            Since many landlords perceive children as causing trouble, discrimination against tenants with children is still common, despite that being illegal under the Fair Housing Act. In fact, Desmond notes in the book that tenants with children are three times as likely to be evicted. This, coupled with a prevalence of urban single mothers, means women are twice as likely to be evicted as men.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            <i>Evicted</i> suggests that in particular, this represents a real crisis for the many black single mothers living under the poverty line in the city. One of Desmond’s most forceful passages, whose pithiness stands in stark relief to its poignancy, reads:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            If incarceration had come to define the lives of men from impoverished black neighborhoods, eviction was shaping the lives of women. Poor black men were locked up. Poor black women were locked out.
                        </blockquote>
                        <h4>
                            Under the complex patchwork of local, state, and federal regulations that form housing law, predatory practices are often rational strategy for landlords who rent to the poorest tenants.
                        </h4>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            To give a few examples: it is in the best interest of these landlords to provide few appliances in their properties, so they have fewer maintenance obligations. It is in the best interest of these landlords to find tenants on social services for the consistent check — even better if they are found incapable of managing their own finances, so that a portion of the government assistance might go directly to landlords. And perhaps most surprisingly, it is in the best interest of these landlords for their tenants to fall behind on rent; once that happens, a variety of legal protections evaporate, allowing landlords to evict tenants extremely easily and leaving tenants afraid to report poor conditions for fear of getting kicked out.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            Desmond makes it clear in the epilogue, which is from his perspective, that he thinks it is unhelpful to blame all the problems with the rental system on “greedy landlords.” Would you want to offer your services for less than market value or forgive missed payments? Nor is he interested in boiling down the issue to “personal responsibility” of tenants or to nebulous “historical systemic forces.”
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            Instead, he focuses on where we as a society ideally have the most agency: policy solutions. Desmond advocates for a 
                            <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/hcv/about/fact_sheet">universal housing voucher</a>, 
                            an alternative to public housing which would provide needy families with rent assistance in the private market while guaranteeing that recipients would only pay 30% of their income on housing. Federally established Fair Market Rent figures for each metropolitan area would limit spending and also ensure that the program would not simply subsidize landlords. However, Desmond acknowledges that his is not the only viable plan, and that the implementation of any plan would necessarily need to be tailored to specific cities. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            If you are interested in becoming more informed on the topic, I recommend reading Evicted for yourself. It raises incisive questions, leaving many unanswered, and has
                            <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/7/9/21316912/joe-biden-housing-plan-section-8">clearly influenced</a>
                            the conversation around housing in America. I also felt that it presented a few discerning counterpoints to strongly pro-development proposals circulating in some
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YIMBY">contemporary liberal circles</a>.
                            That debate is better left for another time, but its very existence is born of the undeniable fact that Desmond’s book sets out to prove: thoughtful legal and policy changes are needed to correct the mismatched incentives in the rental market today.
