                            In high school, I would constantly beg my parents to go out of town for the weekend and leave me behind. But it wasn’t so that I could throw a giant party. I had always been a night owl, staying up late to read, watch Adult Swim, surf the web — but my dad, the resident insomniac, would consistently wake up after 1AM to meditate downstairs, deposing me from my fragile claim to the living room. I yearned to be left alone to take free reign once more. Although at the time I wasn’t introspective enough to really understand it, having the apartment to myself gave me a wonderful sense of freedom and independence.

                            Years later, though, as a college sophomore, I was shocked and confused when my friend Julia, a senior, took me to her studio apartment where she lived alone. <i>How did she keep herself occupied? Wouldn’t she get lonely?</i> I had always assumed that, unless you were in a freshman hall surrounded by peers, living alone was something you did if you were an extreme introvert or didn’t have friends who would want to live with you. But here was a girl who I perceived as a social butterfly and effortlessly cool, staying all by herself.

                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            The extreme irony of my reaction was that, for both years of college up to that point, I had not been super happy with my roommate situation. I didn’t actively dislike my roommates, but we didn’t really spend much time together outside of the dorm, much less become inseparable like some. So when I expressed my surprise that Julia had no roommates, it was not based on any rational appraisal of the downsides of that lifestyle — only on social anxieties that had been conditioned into me as a college student.

                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            Now, in the spring of my senior gap year, it’s my turn to have an apartment to myself. Not forever, and not by my own choice; my roommate, who is from Hong Kong, decided to stay with his family through the Chinese New Year. By the time he returns, I will have been on my own for more than five weeks. But despite some initial apprehension on my part, the solitary experience has turned out to be extremely enjoyable.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            First and foremost, it feels so freeing to have my <i>own</i> space. Don’t get me wrong: I have a great, undemanding roommate who is my close friend, and we get along well. But in any shared living situation, differing lifestyles and common spaces inevitably contribute to conflict between roommates. I don’t even mean “conflict” in the sense of an argument, or any other form of acrimony — just that roommates cannot always do exactly what they would like to at the same time. But with my roommate away, there is never any question over the shared resources in the house. I can cook whenever I want, shower whenever I want, listen to music loudly, and hog the TV. And differences in lifestyle and cleanliness, too minor for me to ever bring up, are no longer an issue.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            Next, having privacy is another great perk. Besides allowing me to drop the towel when I walk from my room to the shower, I can more feel comfortable working out in the living room in my underwear. And although my roommate is very non-judgmental, I don’t need to feel embarrassed if I want to spend an entire day lying on the couch or much too hard at midnight. The lack of disturbances from my roommate means that I have fewer external distractions (I have enough self-inflicted ones to worry about already). Conversely, I don’t need to worry about potentially disturbing my roommate if I want to invite over a couple friends.

                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            All that being said, living alone is not without its downsides. It’s true that having a congenial roommate can be a great social benefit. You can hang out with your roommate without having to make a plan, and Covid-19 is keeping people home more frequently than ever. In addition, roommates can work together to better tackle cooking, household chores, and so on. Finally, the intimacy of shared living can sometimes provide fuel to a strong bond. Despite enjoying my own space, I’m still excited for my roommate to return because I look forward to seeing him.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            Even so, it’s not true that living alone forces you to live as a recluse. Although I consider myself slightly more introverted than extraverted, I think most of my friends would describe me as a social person, and I think I would become lonely relatively quickly spending an extended period of time without human interaction. But after five weeks alone, I still see friends regularly enough to keep me happy, with levels of social distancing that vary based on recent testing and trust. In some ways, I am forced to push myself more to be social — because I don’t have my roommate to fall back on, I need to be proactive and intentional in my friendships.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            But there are definitely days in which I don’t physically see anyone. If the mere thought of being alone fills you with mortal terror, then maybe you shouldn’t live by yourself right now (and maybe you should begin learning to be comfortable and happy independently, a skill that will serve you very well). Even on those days, though, I get my fix from my best friend, with whom I talk over FaceTime nearly every day, even if briefly. Keeping yourself from becoming lonely is very feasible.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            Finally, the other major downside of solo living is the cost. Sharing a house or apartment is a great way to make living more affordable, especially in cities, whose rents can often range from expensive to exorbitant (and don’t get me started on college landlords’ prices). I’m very fortunate right now to be living alone in an apartment meant for two, while only paying for one. Cost is the number one reason that people live with roommates in general, especially in adulthood, and it’s part of the reason why, despite savoring the apartment to myself, I will still live with a roommate next year.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            Cheaper options for single housing definitely exist — my friend who is moving in next year will be paying more — but likely have fewer amenities due to the smaller size. When finding a place on your own is affordable, though, it can be a strong option that also allows you to avoid all of the interpersonal conflicts between roommates and anxieties associated with the college housing search. The scramble for housing arrangements, exacerbated by landlords who set lease renewal deadlines as early as October, has chilled many otherwise strong friendships. When you choose to live alone, you only need to worry about your own housing preferences and you are much less likely to upset anyone — at least, good friends should understand that it’s about you, not them.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-text-black mb-4">
                            When I mention to friends, particularly younger friends, that my roommate has been gone for a while, they express regret for my predicament, and then slight confusion when I follow up that <i>no, I am actually loving it!</i> I can understand their perspective, because it used to be mine. Especially as a college student, it makes a lot of sense to have a roommate or even many roommates. But many Penn students do opt to go it alone and feel satisfied with a good decision that works for their lifestyle. I hope that one day, if those friends of mine are in a situation where living alone starts to make sense, they can see past their preconceptions and remain open to the possibilities.
